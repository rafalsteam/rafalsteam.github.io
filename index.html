			<div class="col-md-6">
				<p> in 1992, our very first shop was opened in Manchester, United Kingdom.
				From its humble start, PetShop has become one of UK's biggest pet stores. The company's growth has been outstanding, showcasing the ability nothing to becoming one of the biggest companies in the UK and also gaining a strong market hold.
                 It was founded by a small group of animal lovers who wanted to create a safe and caring enviroment for every animal and pet owner possible. The shop began as a small store selling basic pet food and supplies, but it quickly became known for its kindness and responsible care. Over the years, PetShop has expanded their stores all over the UK, including grooming services and pet adoption support. Today, it is remembered as a shop built on love, trust and care for animals.
